# You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

# i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

# Answer

#Write your code below this row 👇
total = 0
for number in range(2, 101, 2) :
    total += number
print(total)
