# Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-3. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

#Answer

#Write your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
# str_two_digit_num = str(two_digit_number) -> not required as all the inputted strings are strings only
num1 = int(str_two_digit_num[0])
