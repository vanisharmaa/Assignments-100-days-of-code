# You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.

# Answer

# Import the random module here
import random

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
length = len(names);
random_index = random.randint(0, length-1);
print(names[random_index] + " is going to buy the meal today!")
